Usage prints a usage message documenting all defined command-line flags to CommandLine's output, which by default is os.Stderr. It is called when an error occurs while parsing flags. The function is a variable that may be changed to point to a custom function. By default it prints a simple header and calls PrintDefaults; for details about the format of the output and how to control it, see the documentation for PrintDefaults. Custom usage functions may choose to exit the program; y default exiting happens anyway as the command line's error handling strategy is set to ExitOnError.
